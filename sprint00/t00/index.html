        <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
            <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
            superhero,<b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you need to use
            that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
            For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a
            good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that
            normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>Daredevil</p>
    <p>Daredevil's origins stem from a childhood accident that gave him special abilities.
        While growing up in the historically gritty or crime-ridden working class Irish-American neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen
        in New York City, Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an out-of-control truck after he pushes
        a man out of the path of the oncoming vehicle. While he can no longer see, his exposure to the radioactive material heightens
        his remaining senses beyond normal human ability, and gives him a "radar sense."</p>
